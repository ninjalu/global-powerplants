# global-powerplants
EDA on global power plants data
Update: Jupyter Notebook on Github no longer support Plotly graph. To see all graphs, please clone and re-run the notebook locally.

Fun insights:

1. Good news: Globally, here are almost 2.5 times of renewable source power plants than non_renewable power plants.

2. Bad news: However, because most renewable source power plants (except for nuclear) has only a fraction of the capacity of non_renewable power plants, the leading power source globally is still coal(1st) and gas(2nd), with hydro(3rd) and nuclear (4th). More worryingly, between 2013 and 2017 the power generated from non_renewable sources has increased faster than that of renewable which had a more limited increase.

3. Dirties countries 1: US(1st place) has more than double of the number of non_renewable source power plants than China (2nd place), and almost the total numbers in China, Brazil and Russia combined.

4. Dirties counties 2: China has the most capacity in non_renewable source power plants. Closely 2nd place is US, which is almost 4 times the capacity of the 3rd place India.
